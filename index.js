// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Entry point of the UV index integration.
//
// Role of this file: wire the SDK to the device registry (src/devices/) and to
// the location manager (src/locationEditor.js). It holds NO UV logic — the
// Open-Meteo calls live in src/uv/, the device definition in
// src/devices/uvStation.js, the configured locations in src/locations.js. This
// file only:
//   1. instantiates the SDK (connection, auth, reconnection: handled for you);
//   2. registers the event handlers BEFORE connect();
//   3. publishes one discovered device per configured location, and refreshes
//      that list every time the user adds or removes one;
//   4. gives the location manager the two things it cannot do itself: write the
//      configuration, and re-publish the devices when the list changes.
//
// Environment variables provided by the Gladys supervisor to the container:
//   - GLADYS_HOST_API_URL         (host API URL)
//   - GLADYS_INTEGRATION_TOKEN    (integration-scoped JWT)
//   - GLADYS_INTEGRATION_SELECTOR (integration identifier)
// The SDK reads them automatically: `new GladysIntegration()` is enough.
