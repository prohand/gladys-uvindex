// Two kinds of keys live here:
//   - the ones the user fills in the Configuration form, declared in the
//     `config_schema` of `gladys-assistant-integration.json` (the refresh
//     interval, the language of the device names). Their defaults below MUST
//     match the manifest — a unit test enforces it;
//   - `locations`, written by the integration itself through `gladys.setConfig()`
//     when the user clicks "Add a location" / "Remove a location". It is not in
//     the schema because no static form can hold a list built at runtime; see
//     `src/locations.js`.
//
// A key a former version declared and this one does not is still handed back by
// `getIntegrationConfig`, which returns every stored variable, schema or not. It
// is read by nobody and simply sits there: an integration cannot delete a config
// key.
