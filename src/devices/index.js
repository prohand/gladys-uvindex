// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Device registry.
//
// This integration has a single device TYPE (the UV station) but a variable
// NUMBER of devices: one per location the user configured. So the registry is
// not a static list of blueprints like in the template — each blueprint is a
// projection of `config.locations`.
//
// Every blueprint exposes the same shape:
//   - key                              : short identifier (used in logs)
//   - deviceExternalIds(gladys, config): every external_id it publishes
//   - buildDevices(gladys, config)     : the discovery payloads sent to Gladys
//   - onPoll(gladys, config, id)        (optional): read of ONE device
//   - startPolling / refresh            (optional): self-driven refresh
//   - actions                           (optional): manifest action handlers,
//     keyed by the action `key` declared in gladys-assistant-integration.json
//
// Consequence for the Discovery tab: `publishDiscoveredDevices()` REPLACES the
// previously published list, so re-publishing after every configuration change
// is what makes an added location appear and a removed one disappear.
