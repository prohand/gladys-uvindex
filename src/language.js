//
// Everything this integration says under a button — an action result, a
// connection status — travels as an `{ en, fr }` object and is rendered by
// Gladys in the language of the user reading it: the core picks the key, we
// never choose. Device and feature NAMES are the exception. They are plain
// strings, copied into `t_device_feature.name` the day the user creates the
// device, and the host API tells an integration nothing about who is reading:
// the only language it ever exposes is the one of a messaging contact linked to
// a communication integration (`getContacts()`), which this integration has
// none of.
//
// So the language of the names is a configuration field, and its default is
// FRENCH: the locations are chosen by FRENCH postal code (see
// `src/communes.js`), which makes the user base French-speaking by
// construction.
//
// Note that Gladys renames nothing on re-publish: it upserts the params of the
// devices already created, never their name. Changing the language therefore
// renames the features of the devices still to be created, and leaves the
// existing ones as they were — deleting the device and adding it again from the
// Discovery tab is what renames it.
