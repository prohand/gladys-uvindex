// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The user's locations.
//
// A "location" is one place the user wants a UV device for. The list is the
// single source of truth of the integration:
//   - it drives the devices published in the Discovery tab (one device per
//     location; `publishDiscoveredDevices` REPLACES the previous list, so a
//     removed location disappears from Discovery);
//   - it is stored in the integration configuration under the `locations` key.
//
// WHERE THE LIST IS STORED, and why it is not a config_schema field.
// The Configuration screen is generated from the manifest, which is a static
// file: every field it renders that is not a `section` is an `<input>`, a
// `select` only holds the options the manifest declares, and there is no
// repeatable field type at all. A list the user builds at runtime simply cannot
// be a config_schema entry.
//
// It goes where the core leaves room for it: a key OUTSIDE the schema.
// `setIntegrationConfig` validates the keys the schema declares and treats the
// others as free internal storage of the integration, stored JSON-encoded and
// handed back parsed by `getConfig()`. So the list travels as an array under
// `locations`, and the user manipulates it through the manifest ACTIONS only —
// the message an action resolves to is the one place the Configuration screen
// displays anything this integration has to say.
//
// A location keeps the POSTAL CODE it was created from, next to the point it
// resolved to. The point is what the provider is queried with; the postal code
// is what the user recognizes in a list of five towns, and neither can stand in
// for the other.
//
// Coordinates are stored as TEXT, for the reason spelled out in
// `src/coordinates.js`: `Number('')` is 0, a valid latitude, and a French
// browser turns "48.8566" into an empty string in a `number` field.
